				</div>Hello, my name is Brent Joseph, and I have been doing Graphic Design for a couple years now. I use to make my own graphics when I did YouTube way back in the day and in College.</p> 
				<p>I really got into it again. I started editing my own photos to give them a crazy look. and then I went on to making logos for friends.</p> 
				<p>Not long after, I entered my community's event to make a logo for a company based in the reserve. I did no win but I think the graphic holds up. I want to pursue Graphic Design a bit more, and I hope my portfolio helps!</p>
