				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<h3>Why do you do Graphic Design?</h3>
				<p>Because I thought it was fun when I was in college. Why not continue trying to learn.</p>
				<h3>How did you start?</h3>
				<p>I started back in college. Doing it for assignments. Always wanted to learn so I stuck with it.</p>
				<h3>Why Almostdead?</h3>
				<p> It was my producing alias. Think it is still a real cool name so I'm keeping it.</p>
				<h3>Can you do this thing?</h3>
				<p>Maybe.</p>
